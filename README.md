## Features

- **Terminal-based Gameplay:** Experience classic snake action rendered using [`crossterm`](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm) and randomized food generation via [`rand`](https://github.com/rust-random/rand).
- **Customizable Settings:**
  - **Boundary Sizes:** Choose from Small (20x10), Medium (40x20), or Large (60x30).
  - **Difficulties:** Adjust the game speed with:
    - **Easy:** 300ms per tick
    - **Normal:** 200ms per tick
    - **Hard:** 100ms per tick
- **Dynamic Gameplay Elements:**
  - **Splash Screen:** Enjoy an ASCII art splash screen at the start.
  - **Real-time Controls:** Use arrow keys to steer your snake, spacebar to pause/resume, `+` and `-` to adjust speed, and `q` to quit.
  - **Dynamic Scoring:** Eat the red food (`‚ñ†`) to grow and increase your score, but avoid hitting the walls (`#`) or your own tail.
